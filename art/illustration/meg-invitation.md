description1: I designed and illustrated the invitation digitally, but the finished product was hand-silkscreened.
description2: I worked in SVA's excellent print studios, elbow-to-elbow with undergraduate students finishing their final projects.
description3: The invitations were printed double-sided on cotton rag paper to better accomodate the scoring necessary to fold the invitations to fit in the envelopes.
objective: I wanted to express Megan's South African roots as well as Robbie's Louisiana origins, while alluding to the fun of a wedding in Newport, RI.
