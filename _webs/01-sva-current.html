description1: "The School of Visual Arts is one of NYC's leading art schools. I maintained the flagship institutional site, along with multiple small-scale projects for various departments and school events."
description2: "I was almost exclusively responsible for the Continuing Education domain at SVA, which is the largest revenue driver for the institution after undergraduate tuition."
description3: "I helped design and implement some of the newer and most successful features on sva.edu, like the 'Features' blog, which allowed departments to highlight student, faculty, and alumni news."
description4: "SVA's themed Annual Party was a treat all of the faculty and staff looked forward to. To get everyone excited, our team put together an on-theme invitation website, which interfaced with our RSVP system. I helped design and implement four different annual party sites."
objective: "To highlight the vast and diverse network at SVA through UX and UI that highlight student, alumni, and faculty work and news."
