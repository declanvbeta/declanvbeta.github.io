description1: "Enter your location and a time limit, and head to an amazing spot. The catch is, you won't know where you're headed until you arrive. "
description2: "Mashable and Intel sponsored a Hackathon to bring together designers and developers. Luckily, I was both."
description3: "I developed the concept for the application, designed, styled, and helped implement the front end, and Trinity Montoya handled the backend."
description4: "Users are given directions one step at a time so their destination is kept a secret until they arrive."
