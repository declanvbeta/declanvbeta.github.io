objective: To design and engineer an intuitive tool for delivering bulletproof, responsive, and stylish messages to SVA's wide audience of students, alumni, faculty, and influencers.
description1: "Email is suprisingly hard to design and build for. <br>There are so many combinations of email clients and devices to consider, and many clients (like Gmail) aggressively remove CSS, JS, video, and anything fancy. The challenge was to design a system that cranks out reliable, table-based html that looks great in everybody's inbox."
description2: "Using lightweight bespoke Javascript, I built a robust tool with an extensive list of features to empower our Communication Office to craft vibrant messages for the SVA community."
description3: "Users can undo and redo their actions, import content from existing sva.edu event pages, add images, links, headings, import and export HTML, and ultimately develop responsive, tasteful emails."
description4: "The messages created with this tool were read by a huge audience of students, faculty, and alumni."
