description1: "A bespoke website seemed an appropriate accompaniment to the hand-printed invitations and other small details we planned for our wedding."
description2: We wanted to playfully entice our guests to travel a long way to join us on our special day. One way was to contrast their weather with Floridaâ€™s.
description3: "To help our guests find their way around town, I built this interactive map with info and links for cool spots."
objective: My wife and I wanted a site that reflected our individual backgrounds, and expressed our joy in celebrating with everyone we love in a beautiful place.
